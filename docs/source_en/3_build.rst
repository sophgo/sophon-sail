SAIL Compilation and Installation
_____________________________________________________

*Note: BM1688 processor only supports soc related compilation options, BM1684 and BM1684X processors do not have this restriction.*

Compilation Parameters
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

* ``BUILD_TYPE`` : It is used to specify the type of compilation, currently there are three modes: pcie, soc and arm_pcie. pcie means to compile the SAIL package available on the x86 host, soc means to use cross-compilation to compile the SAIL package available on the soc of the x86 host. arm_pcie means to use cross-compilation to compile the SAIL package available on the x86 host with a bm168x card plugged in. The default is pcie.
   
* ``ONLY_RUNTIME`` : It is used to specify whether the compilation result contains only runtime but not bmcv, sophon-ffmpeg, or sophon-opencv; if this compilation option is ON, this SAIL encoding and decoding and the Bmcv interface are not available, and only the inference interface is available. The default is OFF.
   
* ``INSTALL_PREFIX`` : It is used to specify the installation path when executing make install, default "/opt/sophon" in pcie mode, same as the installation path of libsophon, default "build_soc" in cross-compile mode.
   
* ``PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`` : It is used to specify the path name (path+name) of "python3" for compilation; by default, the default python3 of the current system is used.
   
* ``CUSTOM_PY_LIBDIR`` : It is used to specify the path of the python3 dynamic library to be used for compilation (path only); by default, the current system's default python3 dynamic library directory is used.
   
* ``LIBSOPHON_BASIC_PATH`` : It is used to specify the path of libsophon in cross-compile mode; if the configuration is not correct, the compilation will fail. In pcie mode, this compilation option does not take effect.
   
* ``FFMPEG_BASIC_PATH`` : It is used to specify the path of sophon-ffmpeg in cross-compile mode; if the configuration is not correct and ONLY_RUNTIME is "OFF", the compilation will fail. In pcie mode, this compilation option does not take effect.
   
* ``OPENCV_BASIC_PATH`` : It is used to specify the path of sophon-opencv in cross-compile mode; if the configuration is not correct and ONLY_RUNTIME is "OFF", the compilation will fail. In pcie mode, this compilation option does not take effect.

* ``TOOLCHAIN_BASIC_PATH`` : It is used to specify the path of cross-compiler in cross-compile mode. Currently it only takes effect when BUILD_TYPE is loongarch.

* ``BUILD_PYSAIL`` : It is used to specify whether the compilation result contains the python version of SAIL. The default is "ON", which includes the python version of SAIL.



Compile dynamic libraries and header files that can be called by the C++ interface

**.Compiling SAIL with a Specific Python Version**

If the python3 version in the production environment is not the same as the development environment, you can make it consistent by upgrading the python3 version.
You can also get the corresponding python3 package through the official python3 website.
Or you can download the already compiled python3 from [:ref:`Get Python3 for cross-compilation on the X86 host`].
That is, use the non-system default python3, compile SAIL containing bmcv, sophon-ffmpeg, and sophon-opencv, and package it in the "build_pcie" directory.
The path of python3 used in this example is "python_3.8.2/bin/python3", and the dynamic library directory of python3 is "python_3.8.2/lib".

1. Download the SOPHON-SAIL source code, unpack it and go to its source code directory

2. Create the build folder "build" and go to the "build" folder

    .. parsed-literal::
        mkdir build && cd build                   

3. Execute the compilation command

    .. parsed-literal::
        cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python_3.8.2/bin/python3 -DCUSTOM_PY_LIBDIR=python_3.8.2/lib ..

PCIE MODE
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
After compiling SAIL with PCIE MODE and installing SAIL's c++ libraries by running "sudo make install" or by copying them.
It is recommended to use cmake to link the SAIL libraries to your application.
If you need to use SAIL multimedia-related functions, you also need to add libsophon, sophon-ffmpeg, sophon-opencv header file directory, and dynamic library directory to your program.
You can add the following paragraph to your program's CMakeLists.txt:

.. parsed-literal::

    find_package(libsophon REQUIRED)
    include_directories(${LIBSOPHON_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    # Add libsophon's header file directories

    set(SAIL_DIR  /opt/sophon/sophon-sail/lib/cmake)
    find_package(SAIL REQUIRED)
    include_directories(${SAIL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    link_directories(${SAIL_LIB_DIRS})
    # Add SAIL header files and dynamic library directories

    set(OpenCV_DIR  /opt/sophon/sophon-opencv-latest/lib/cmake/opencv4)
    find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)
    include_directories(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    # Add the header file directories of sophon-opencv

    set(FFMPEG_DIR  /opt/sophon/sophon-ffmpeg-latest/lib/cmake)
    find_package(FFMPEG REQUIRED)
    include_directories(${FFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    link_directories(${FFMPEG_LIB_DIRS})
    # Add the header file directories and dynamic library directories of sophon-ffmpeg

    add_executable(${YOUR_TARGET_NAME} ${YOUR_SOURCE_FILES})
    target_link_libraries(${YOUR_TARGET_NAME} sail)


The functions in sail can be called from within your code:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #define USE_FFMPEG  1
    #define USE_OPENCV  1
    #define USE_BMCV    1

    #include <stdio.h>

    #include <string>

    using namespace std;

    int main() 
    {
        int device_id = 0;
        std::string video_path = "test.avi";
        sail::Decoder decoder(video_path,true,device_id);
        if(!decoder.is_opened()){
            printf("Video[%s] read failed!\n",video_path.c_str());
            exit(1) ;
        }
        
        sail::Handle handle(device_id);

        }

        return 0;
    }


SOC MODE
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**.Compile the program on the SOC device**

After installing libsophon, sophon-ffmpeg, sophon-opencv, and SAIL on the SOC device, you can use cmake to link the libraries in SAIL to your application by referring to the PCIE MODE development method.
If you need to use SAIL multimedia-related functions, you also need to add libsophon, sophon-ffmpeg, and sophon-opencv header file directories and dynamic library directories to your application.


**.Cross-compile programs on x86 hosts**

If you want to build a cross-compilation environment using SAIL, you will need libsophon, sophon-ffmpeg, sophon-opencv, and the gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu toolchain.

**.Create the "soc-sdk" folder**

Create the "soc-sdk" folder, the header files and dynamic libraries needed for subsequent cross-compilation will be stored in this directory.

    .. parsed-literal::
        mkdir soc-sdk

**.Get the libsophon,sophon-ffmpeg,sophon-opencv libraries needed for cross-compilation**

*The following examples choose to use libsophon version 0.4.1, sophon-ffmpeg version 0.4.1, and sophon-opencv version 0.4.1.*

1. Get "libsophon_soc_0.4.1_aarch64.tar.gz" from sophon's official website and unpack and copy it to the "soc-sdk" folder

        sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu

After the above steps are configured, you can finish cross-compiling by configuring cmake. Add the following paragraph to your program's CMakeLists.txt:

*CMakeLists.txt needs to use "/opt/sophon/soc-sdk" as the absolute path to "soc-sdk", which needs to be configured according to the actual location of the file when it is applied.*

    set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER aarch64-linux-gnu-g++)
    
    include_directories("/opt/sophon/soc-sdk/include")
    include_directories("/opt/sophon/soc-sdk/include/sail")
    # Add the header file directories to be used for cross-compilation

    link_directories("/opt/sophon/soc-sdk/lib")
    # Add dynamic library directories to be used for cross-compilation

    add_executable(${YOUR_TARGET_NAME} ${YOUR_SOURCE_FILES})
    target_link_libraries(${YOUR_TARGET_NAME} sail)
    # sail is the library that needs to be linked


ARM PCIE MODE
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

**.Compile the program on the ARM host**

After installing libsophon, sophon-ffmpeg, sophon-opencv, and SAIL on the ARM host, you can use cmake to link the libraries in SAIL to your application by referring to the PCIE MODE development method.
If you need to use SAIL multimedia-related functions, you also need to add libsophon, sophon-ffmpeg, and sophon-opencv header file directories and dynamic library directories to your application.


**.Cross-compile programs on x86 hosts**

If you want to build a cross-compilation environment using SAIL, you will need libsophon, sophon-ffmpeg, sophon-opencv, and the gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu toolchain.

**.Create the "arm_pcie-sdk" folder**

Create the "arm_pcie-sdk" folder, the header files and dynamic libraries needed for subsequent cross-compilation will be stored in this directory.

    .. parsed-literal::
        mkdir arm_pcie-sdk

**.Get the libsophon,sophon-ffmpeg,sophon-opencv libraries needed for cross-compilation**

*The following examples choose to use libsophon version 0.4.1, sophon-ffmpeg version 0.4.1, and sophon-opencv version 0.4.1.*

1. Get "libsophon_0.4.1_aarch64.tar.gz" from sophon's official website and unpack and copy it to the "arm_pcie-sdk" folder

    .. parsed-literal::
        tar -xvf libsophon_0.4.1_aarch64.tar.gz
        cp -r libsophon_0.4.1_aarch64/opt/sophon/libsophon-0.4.1/include arm_pcie-sdk
        cp -r libsophon_0.4.1_aarch64/opt/sophon/libsophon-0.4.1/lib arm_pcie-sdk
        
The directory of libsophon after unpacking is "libsophon_0.4.1_aarch64/opt/sophon/libsophon-0.4.1"

2. Get "sophon-mw_0.4.1_aarch64.tar.gz" from sophon's official website and unpack and copy it to the "arm_pcie-sdk" folder

    .. parsed-literal::
        tar -xvf sophon-mw_0.4.1_aarch64.tar.gz
        cp -r sophon-mw_0.4.1_aarch64/opt/sophon/sophon-ffmpeg_0.4.1/include arm_pcie-sdk
        cp -r sophon-mw_0.4.1_aarch64/opt/sophon/sophon-ffmpeg_0.4.1/lib arm_pcie-sdk
        cp -r sophon-mw_0.4.1_aarch64/opt/sophon/sophon-opencv_0.4.1/include/opencv4/opencv2 arm_pcie-sdk/include
        cp -r sophon-mw_0.4.1_aarch64/opt/sophon/sophon-opencv_0.4.1/lib arm_pcie-sdk

**.Copy the cross-compiled SAIL, i.e. "build_arm_pcie", to the "arm_pcie-sdk" folder**

    .. parsed-literal::
        cp build_arm_pcie/sophon-sail/include arm_pcie-sdk
        cp build_arm_pcie/sophon-sail/lib arm_pcie-sdk

**.Install the gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu toolchain**

*If already installed, you can ignore this step*

    .. parsed-literal::
        sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu

After the above steps are configured, you can finish cross-compiling by configuring cmake. Add the following paragraph to your program's CMakeLists.txt:
